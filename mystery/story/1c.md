~~It's too hard to decide. Just go home for the day, demand mom make you something better for lunch, and demand she buys you that new album while she's at it. It's about time she started giving instead of always taking!~~

Yeah! Mom's always asking so much of you. Always making sure you do your homework. Also hassling you about your chores. Also making sure you wash your hands before dinner. Come on mom, talk about lame! Its about time she started treating you like an adult. Time to give her a piece of your mind.

You stomp your way back home, and demand she make you something better for lunch. This is inhuman treatment! Cruel and unusual punishment! No one should have to suffer the same PB&J every lunch, day after day! You're not some animal!

...

Uh oh. Looks like mom isn't very happy with your tone. You're in big trouble this time.

She really gives it to you. After an hour and a half of yelling, looks like you've been grounded. And what's more, she says that since you're so eager to be treated like an adult, you won't be getting an allowance anymore! Now you won't be able afford *Music Band*'s new album.

What a bummer. Maybe she has a point though. Maybe you should've been a little nicer to your mom.

**THE END**
