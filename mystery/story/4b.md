~~Talk to them directly~~
You approach Helga Hex and Doctor Database.

You try to do your best grizzled cop impression, saying "Alright, what've we got?" in a husky voice.

Helga and the Doctor look at each other with a puzzled expression.

The Doctor says, "Looks like Mr. Body was murdered with this lead pipe here."

Helga says, "This pipe right here?" and picks it up.

The Doctor exclaims, "What are you doing! That pipe is evidence! You can't pick that up, you've just contaminated the evidence. We won't be able to get fingerprints from it now!"

Helga smiles sheepishly.

### Choice
1. [Wait a minute. Helga should've known not to pick up the pipe. Everyone knows not to touch evidence at a crime scene. UNLESS... she was purposely trying to contaminate the pipe so that you wouldn't be able to lift her prints from it. Accuse her.](5a.md)
1. [Seriously, where did this Doctor even come from? Isn't it pretty suspicious that he ran in just after Mr. Body was murdered? It must've been him. Accuse him.](5b.md)
1. [Approach Billy](3b.md)
1. [Approach Danny](3c.md)
