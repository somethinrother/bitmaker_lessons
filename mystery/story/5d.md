~~Accuse Danny Decrement~~

**CLUE:** Danny was standing right beside the light switches when they went off, he's the most likely person to have turned out the lights.

Did he really just say that out loud? He said "How am I ever going to clean up this mess?" That's a confession if you've ever heard one.

You try to play the good cop, saying calmly, "Danny, clearly you've got a guilty conscience. Why not come clean? I know it was you who killed Mr. Body. Maybe if you confess, the law will go easy on you."

"What?" Danny says, "No, I didn't kill anybody!"

"Come on Danny, you were standing right beside the light switches when the lights went out. You were just talking about *cleaning up this mess*."

"No, no, I meant how am I going to actually clean up this body," he responds, "There's blood all over the floor, what a disaster!"

"I think that's usually the sort of thing the police take care of," you say.

"And besides," he continues, ignoring you, "Even if I was over by the lights, there's no way I could've turned off the lights, run over to Mr. Body, killed him, and then run back here while the lights were off. It all happened way too fast."

He's got a point. The lights were only off for a second. Seems a little far fetched to think that he could run all the way back and forth in just a couple seconds.

Maybe you've jumped the gun here a little bit.

In the end, the murderer was never apprehended.

**THE END**
