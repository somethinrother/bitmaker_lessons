~~Accuse Doctor Database~~

"Where did you even come from?" you yell suddenly in Doctor Database's face, "Who are you dude? Isn't it a little suspicious that you came running in just after the murder? Maybe you killed him!"

Doctor Database looks hurt by your accusation.

"I'm a Doctor!" he exclaims, "I've been sworn to do no harm! I would never do such a thing!"

"Are you even a real Doctor?" you ask.

Doctor Database pauses for a moment, and says, "Well, I don't have a *medical* doctorate, but I'm a Doctor of philosophy."

"What? How does that qualify you to pronounce someone dead? You're not even a real Doctor man!" you say.

Doctor Database begins to sob uncontrollably. He storms off muttering something about how he is too a real Doctor, and how he deserves more respect.

You look around the room and notice a lot of angry faces. Seems like your classmates didn't appreciate you picking on poor Doctor Database. Come to think of it, he's probably a little too sensitive to commit something as terrible as murder. And why would he make such a big deal about catching the murderer if *he was the murderer*.

Maybe you missed some important detail. Doesn't look like you're gonna get to the bottom of it today though.

**THE END**
