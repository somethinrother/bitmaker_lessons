# Terror at Bitmaker Labs!

It's a normal day at Bitmaker, just like any other. You just finished the morning lecture. It was pretty boring, the teacher was droning on and on about the value of Teamwork or something. You weren't really listening, caught yourself nodding off a couple of times. Teachers can be such a drag! Talk about Groan Zone.

Now seems like a good time to get some lunch. You take a peek at the bagged lunch your mom packed you. Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich. Granny Smith apple. Gold Fish crackers. Typical mom stuff. Dependable. A bit plain. Kinda boring.

Maybe you should just go down the street and buy yourself something from a food truck. It would definitely top PB&J. But you've been saving up your allowance for *Music Band*'s fire new album, *Hip Tunes For Fellow Kids*. And if you buy yourself something else to eat, you won't be able to afford it.

### Choice
Will you:

1. [Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes.](1a.md).
1. [Live in the moment, and get yourself a burrito at the food truck. Carpe Diem, seize the fish.](1b.md)
1. [It's too hard to decide. Just go home for the day, demand mom make you something better for lunch, and demand she buys you that new album while she's at it. It's about time she started giving instead of always taking!](1c.md)
