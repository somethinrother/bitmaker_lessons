~~Listen in on what they're saying~~

You stand a little away and eavesdrop on Helga's conversation with the Doctor.

Helga says, "What's the cause of death Doctor Database?"

"Looks like Mr. Body suffered blunt force trauma to the back of the head with this lead pipe," Doctor Database responds, pointing to the lead pipe lying beside Mr. Body.

"How horrible," says Helga, "Perhaps we should question the witnesses? See if anyone noticed anything?"

"No," he responds, "I think I'd better finish my examination first."

"Where did this lead pipe even come from?" Helga inquires.

"This isn't the sort of thing people just have laying around," Doctor Database says, "Not unless you're a plumber or something."

Doctor Database goes quiet for a moment, and then remarks, "Say Helga, how's your personal life? Didn't you tell me the other day you were doing some home renovations?"

1. [Seriously, where did this Doctor even come from? Isn't it pretty suspicious that he ran in just after Mr. Body was murdered? It must've been him. Accuse him.](5b.md)
