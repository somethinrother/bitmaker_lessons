I'm afraid you've been bamboozled. You didn't think you were the only one cheating, did you?

It turns out, there is no available correct choice, because Mr. Body was murdered by not just one suspect, but several of them! It was a grand conspiracy.

Billy Binary was in charge of distracting the students, so they wouldn't notice what the others were up to, which is why he was with the students at the time of the murder, and was trying to convince them nothing was amiss afterwards.

Danny Decrement was the one who turned out the lights. He was also in charge of the cover up, and planting evidence to frame someone else. Unfortunately the meddlesome Doctor Database was watching over Mr. Body, keeping him from interfering, which is why he was so nervous.

Helga Hex swung the pipe that killed Mr. Body. Her fingerprints were on the pipe, and so she was trying to not only contaminate the evidence, but also lure Doctor Database away so that Danny could frame someone else.

The conspirators didn't plan on Doctor Database being in the building, or on you trying to find the murderer.
