~~Approach Danny~~

Danny looks nervous. Very suspicious. He seems like a good person to question.

You walk up to Danny. He doesn't notice you approach, he's lost in thought. You clear your throat to get his attention.

"Hey Danny," you say, "What are you doing over here all by yourself?"

He smiles weakly in response.

"Just taking out the trash," he says.

"Danny, you look awfully worried," you say, "More than everyone else in this room. You got something you need to say?"

Danny thinks for a second, and responds, "How am I ever going to clean up this mess?", and goes back to mumbling to himself.
