~~Accuse Billy Binary~~
**CLUE:** Billy seems to be making a lot of silly excuses for some reason.

"Come on Billy, I know you're hiding something", you accuse him, "You're making a lot of weird excuses for what's plainly murder. Your story just doesn't feel right. Why don't you just confess? I think you're the one who murdered Mr. Body!"

Billy laughs humourlessly, and says, "Come on. My story doesn't feel right? What does that even mean."

"Billy was with me the whole time", Suzy chimes in, "Helping me with a question. How could it have been him? You've got the wrong guy."

Whoops. Looks like Billy was with Suzy Sort when the murder happened. Seems like you might've made a mistake. He is acting a little strange, but his alibi seem solid.

Seems like you might've missed something important.

In the end, after wasting a bunch of time confirm Billy and Suzy's story, you weren't able to come to any conclusions, and the murderer got away.

**THE END**
