He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
He didn't know how they were there... but they were.
but he could hear them coming.
It was dark, cold, and clammy. "I kind of want to take a shower..."
It was a late afternoon at Bitmaker..
and Omair was eyeing the last slice of pizza
but it was too late... when he turned his head again it was gone
the greatest tragedy humanity has yet seen.
